                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Vision:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">In a world where we are under constant pressure to find our perfect match, we believe encouraging and destigmatizing casual, consensual &amp; possibly kinky connections could benefit lonely and lost expats in terms of health, confidence, and settling in the new place they want to call home now.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Values + Copywriting:&nbsp;</strong></p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Sensuality:</strong>&nbsp;A common misconception: Sensuality does not equal sexuality. It goes beyond the act of physical intimacy. Sensuality describes the experience of our bodies and the world surrounding us, which requires an awareness of all our senses. Sexpats presents opportunities to everybody to reflect and get in touch with individual needs and wants to improve the quality of (non) sexual connections in the long run.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Connection:</strong>&nbsp;Humans require connection because it satisfies our need for social interaction, offers emotional support and a sense of belonging, and significantly improves both our mental and physical health. Sexpats sees the importance in human connections, therefore is focused on building networks and social interactions that helps customers feel like they’re part of something bigger than themselves.</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Acceptance:</strong> To be an expat means to be a foreigner in a place you want to call home. Lacking the knowledge of how people from different nationalities behave in the dating world can cause a clash of cultures and lead to feelings of alienation and misunderstanding. Sexpats brings people together because we see the importance of embracing and accepting each other's cultural differences.</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Health:</strong> Not the very first thing that would come to mind with getting laid, but health is something very important for expats. In the forms of being in a new environment it might be stressful for expats and they may forget to look after themselves. We want expats to be healthy in the physical, mental and sexual way.</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Persona:</strong></p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Background:</strong> Ruben, age 27, is an ambitious and hardworking young man who moved to the Netherlands to pursue a more promising future. He graduated from university a few years ago with a degree in Marketing and Communications. In the duration of his study, Ruben focused mainly on his course and gaining the necessary knowledge to be a successful specialist in his field.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">His unemployment has made it difficult to create connections, which has been a source of stress and isolation. Ruben currently works as a barista until he finds a suitable job for his professional skills. Goals: Ruben's primary goal is to find a stable job as a Marketing Consultant in Amsterdam.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Moreover, as a young individual whose life is before him, he is curious to discover the culture and learn more about the Dutch people. Ruben doesn't want to settle down just yet. Instead, this young man is interested in casual, consensual &amp; possibly kinky connections to take his mind off his busy routine.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"></p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Challenges:</strong> Ruben's goal is to keep prospering in his field. Unfortunately, he has yet to find a job in his area of work, making the Netherlands a very stressful and lonely place to which he is not accustomed. Due to the current circumstances, Ruben's initially laid-back, outgoing, and adventurous personality has turned into a shell of what it used to be.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Motivation:</strong> During sexual acts, the body releases endorphins and oxytocin, which induce feelings of relaxation and connection while helping to prevent anxiety and depression.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Thus, Ruben is passionate about engaging in noncommital rendezvous to feel recharged to tackle his biggest struggle - finding a job in Marketing and Communications.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Important behaviors:</strong> In his spare time, Ruben searches for job offers, and when the opportunity arises, he goes on interviews. On most days, he works as a barista at a local touristy cafe, and when he is available, Ruben likes to travel around and explore the country. He and his friends go out for the weekend.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Consumer Insights:</strong> Ruben spends significant time on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram to stay connected with friends and family back home and discover new places and events in their new country of residence. He uses dating apps and online platforms to meet new people but is cautious regarding his safety and privacy.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>A Typical Day for Ruben:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">7:00 AM - The alarm goes off, and Ruben gets ready to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">8:00 AM - Ruben leaves his studio and cycles to the local touristy cafe where he works.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">8:30 AM - He prepares the cafe for customers.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">9:00 AM - Ruben officially opens the cafe.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">12:00 PM - While Ruben enjoys his lunch break, he scrolls through Instagram and chats with friends.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">12:30 PM - Ruben goes back to work.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">3:15 PM - Ruen goes on a 15-minute break and spends it on social media again because baristas rarely take breaks together, depending on how busy it is.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">5:00 PM - Ruben heads home after a long day at work.&nbsp;</p>

                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">7:00 PM - Ruben eats dinner alone.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">8:00 PM - Ruben looks for a job and applies for suitable positions.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">9:30 PM - Ruben watches TV and goes to bed after.&nbsp;</p>

Red symbolises heat, activity, passion, sexuality, love and joy.<br><br>#D91A4D The pink radiates romance, delicateness and a charming energy.<br><br>#66097D The vivid purple reflects sensuality and mystery.<br><br><strong>Font Choices:&nbsp;<br></strong>Roboto Mono / 29LT Zawi, Raleway, Jost<br><br>UX Patterns: The carousel on our landing pages welcomes every visitor with heart-warming, connection-related images and a specific value of our brand.  
We chose to implement the image <strong> carousel</strong> to introduce the visitor to our website in an attractive way, since looking at visuals preferred over static text and endless paragraphs.&nbsp;</p> 

 

 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Furthermore, scrolling down, visitors see our brand vision. The brand vision is headlined with an intriguing slogan, purposely in two of our <strong>fonts of choice (Raleway, Roboto Mono). </strong>&nbsp;</p>

 
 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Most importantly, the paragraph of the brand vision is visually supported through a small and <strong>subtle video in the background.</strong> We <strong>lowered the opacity</strong> on the video to not distract the visitor and just make it a subtle, visually pleasing addition and more interesting background.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">We choose the video of the clouds to visualize the “expat” and “connections all over the world” aspect of our brand, but also to underline the “lightweight feeling” of love and excitement we stand for as a brand. The paragraph closes with <strong>two buttons that include different calls-to-action:</strong> One to directly lead the visitor to our sign-up page, the other to direct the visitor to our about us page to cover any additional information.&nbsp;</p>

 

 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">We purposely choose to keep the overall look of the website more on the light and colourful side, because we actively try to avoid the overly sexual appearance of other common dating platforms. Although we openly promote sexual connections, we are catering to young professionals and adult expats that are interested in finding a partner for sex or their connection of choice, but they do not want to visit websites that necessarily look like it.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Therefore, we <strong>decided to limit the use of colour and to maintain the lighter look of the website</strong> in general.&nbsp;</p>

 

 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The <strong>top horizontal navigation menu</strong> ensures that the visitor has a clear overview of the most important things about our brand and is able to intuitively navigate through our website at all times.&nbsp;</p> 

 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">We choose <strong>six different navigation tabs</strong> Home, About Us, Contact, Crowdfunding, Corporate and Sign Up. Home and Corporate are self-explanatory.&nbsp;</p>
 

 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>About Us</strong> includes all information regarding the team, our values and the purpose we serve as a brand. To make it easy to understand, we choose <strong>three icons</strong> (globus for cross-cultural, international connection / <strong>light bulb</strong> to communicate literal enlightenment and learning / <strong>smiley</strong> for love, joy and happiness – no matter if it is platonic or sexual) that represent what we can provide our customers with.&nbsp;</p>  

 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">We chose to implement <strong>a horizontal 4-image-gallery</strong> with fruit-themed pictures to tie it together with our Instagram posts where we already used the fruit theme repeatedly. The <strong>fruits symbolise freshness, health and are also subtly sexualised</strong> within our posts and across our website.&nbsp;</p> 

 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">To visually connect our team information with our contact information, both parts are divided into <strong>4 blocks</strong> and <strong>shaded in one of our brand colours</strong> (orange, #F89F15).&nbsp;</p> 

 
 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The separate <strong>contact tab</strong> is intended to make it quick, easy and accessible for people that are curious and interested in directly contacting us, ideally to discuss a possible investment in our brand.&nbsp;</p>  

 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">We choose to add this tab, because it reduces the distance and time potential investors need to spend on our site in order to know how to reach out to us.&nbsp;</p>

 
 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Within the <strong>crowdfunding tab</strong>, we obviously elaborate on why we are worth every penny of investment. We imagine our brand to still be a work in progress, therefore the <strong>form</strong> to sign up serves the purpose for future members of our community to be part of our development and stay in the loop of things, until we reach a point where we can provide the finished app.&nbsp;</p> 

 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The form is visually supported through a paradise-like image, that is intended to evoke positive, dreamy feelings and touch upon the “international” and “expat” aspect of our brand.&nbsp;</p>  

 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The form is followed by a <strong>funding tier plan</strong>, that we intendedly kept short and compressed to make it easily understandable what we are looking for in additional funding.&nbsp;

                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Context of The Marketing and Communication Campaign</strong>&nbsp;</p>
									<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Expats are usually individuals who have chosen to relocate to a different country for numerous reasons, such as better opportunities for professional development and a better standard of life. However, turning your back on everything you have ever known and starting anew in a different country is a scary and stressful experience. Expats are curious to discover the culture and get to know the natives but find it challenging to create an environment or socialize.&nbsp;</p> 

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Our target audience is lonely expats looking for an intimate partner to engage in casual, consensual, and possibly kinky connections but who have no knowledge of how to seduce people from different cultures. The goal of Sexpat's social media campaign is to introduce lonely single expats to our brand and educate and entertain them. We want our target audience to feel excited, hopeful, and confident through finding partners in their new environment. Thus, we have created four differently themed days branded with our values and targeted to expats.&nbsp;</p>  

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Expats are often overridden with stress and have a high chance of experiencing feelings of alienation and pressure to find the right match. Unfortunately, their lack of knowledge about how to seduce people from different cultures prevents them from enjoying their time here and engaging in flings. Hence, we believe that encouraging and destigmatizing casual, consensual, and possibly kinky connections could aid lonely and lost expats in terms of health, confidence, and settling in the new location.&nbsp;</p> 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>The Reach objective</strong> aims to generate awareness of the brand and its offerings. Sexpats wants to achieve 1000 views on Instagram, 500 views on Facebook, and 100 visits to their website. This will help the brand reach a wider audience and attract potential customers.&nbsp;</p> 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>The Affective objective</strong> aims to create a positive emotional response in the target audience. Sexpats want to make lonely expats feel excited, hopeful, and confident about finding partners in their new environment. The brand hopes to achieve this by having five people join the designated Facebook group. This will help to build a sense of community and support among expats.&nbsp;</p> 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>The Response objective</strong> aims to encourage the target audience to engage with the brand and its offerings. Sexpats wants to encourage expats to visit their website, create a profile, and engage with other users. The brand hopes to achieve this by having 250 likes across all platforms, 100 followers on Instagram, and 100 followers on Facebook. This will help to create a loyal customer base and increase brand engagement.&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Channels and Promotional Activities</strong> </p>
								

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Channels:</strong> We created high-quality content that our target audience enjoys watching on Instagram and Facebook.&nbsp;</p> 

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Promotional activities:</strong> We posted traditional posts, carousel posts, and reels on Instagram and Facebook. Each posting day had its designated theme - Speak and Spit Mondays, Culture Clash Wednesdays, Fun on Fridays, and Safe Sex Saturdays.&nbsp;</p> 

 
 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
<strong>Reflection</strong> </p> 
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">&nbsp;</p>
 

 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Week 1</strong> </p> 

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Instagram:</strong> It was a successful week driving traffic to our Instagram page. The posts on Monday and Saturday performed better than those on Wednesday and Friday. However, the reach decreased with each post. We posted two traditional Instagram posts with fewer graphics and more text on Monday and Wednesday and two carousel posts on Friday and Saturday. Both carousel posts were informative and supported by illustrations or pictures. However, the carousel post with pictures outperformed the previous three.&nbsp;</p>  

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Due to the interactivity of the carousel posts, the audience engages more with them, and users spend more time looking at them than at traditional Instagram feed posts. Hence, the algorithm is informed that our target audience finds our content relevant and intriguing, which may result in more people seeing our posts on their feeds.&nbsp;</p> 

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Facebook:</strong> Our team linked our Instagram page to our Facebook page, so the posts were automatically uploaded to Facebook. We spent little time on our Facebook page and drove a little traffic. We had minimal reach with our posts, and it varied between three and eight people. Surprisingly, the post on Friday, the carousel with the illustrations, was the most reached - 15 people. Nonetheless, we did not boost any of our posts. Hence, they did not reach as many people as they would have if we had used this option and the 'reach' feature.&nbsp;</p> 

 
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Week 2</strong> 

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Instagram:</strong> This week, we experimented with reels that followed the assigned theme. The reel on Monday was an animated post with no sound, whereas the reel on Wednesday was a still one with suitable music for the post. The animated reel got more likes, but the reel supported by audio got more views. Therefore, people engage more with reels containing audio because of the emotional engagement they receive. Even so, posts with moveable visuals or still posts with audio are not considered the most attention-grabbing reels. Hence, we decided to proceed with traditional posts and create reels based on current trendy TikTok videos.&nbsp;</p> 

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The post on Friday was a traditional post. However, we used a bigger picture that would take up more space, added a few designs and very little text. Furthermore, it reached the most people out of every post for the week. The post on Saturday was a carousel consisting mainly of text on a background design. We concluded that the posts where the main focus is a picture supported by few designs and less text are the ones the audience interacts with the most.&nbsp;</p> 

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Facebook:</strong> The same tendency with the reels on Instagram can also be observed on Facebook. The reel on Monday, which was only visual, reached five people and was viewed 14 times. However, the reel on Wednesday, which was still but supported by audio, reached 60 people and was played 60 times. Therefore, the audience on Facebook is also more interested in audio and visual posts rather than only visual ones.&nbsp;</p> 

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The traditional singular post on Friday reached three people more compared to the one on Saturday, which was multiple pictures consisting mainly of text. The results can be consequences of the traditional singular post being a big picture, making it more attention-grabbing.&nbsp;</p> 

 
 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>
Week 3</strong> </p> 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Instagram:</strong> Since this was the last week of our Marketing and Communication campaign, we decided to post one more day than previously scheduled. The posts on Monday and Wednesday followed the same pattern as the first week; expectedly, the posts with less text performed better.&nbsp;</p> 

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">On Friday, we posted a traditional singular post again. However, this one had images used in the design and less text and performed as well as the post on Monday. The post on Saturday was a carousel but with text only again. However, it reached more people compared to the post on Wednesday, which was a traditional singular.&nbsp;</p> 

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">We posted a reel using a CapCut template inspired by a trend on TikTok. It reached more people than the posts, predominantly with text, but less than the ones on Monday and Friday.&nbsp;</p> 

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Facebook:</strong> The usual posts performed relatively the same as Week 1, reaching fewer people. However, the reel reached 200 people and was viewed 209 times. Therefore, using trendy TikToks to create our promotional content worked out perfectly for Facebook.&nbsp;</p> 

 

 
 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>
Expectations</strong> </p>  
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Regarding meeting our objectives, we expected that it would be more attainable to accomplish our reach objective for Instagram - reaching 500 people. However, our reach at the beginning of Week 4, after we finished posting, was 230 people, almost half the goal we had set. Also, we expected our posts to receive more engagement when promoting them on stories; however, this was not the case.&nbsp;</p> 

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Moreover, we did not have an assigned theme initially, but after we saw the order of colors for the posts we had already published, we realized that it would be a good idea to keep up with the theme.&nbsp;</p> 

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Since we started very promisingly, we expected to continue with the same success and increase our reach. However, the engagement and reach on our posts decreased, and we could not figure out the cause of it. Hence, we tried promoting them on stories, but it was not helpful.&nbsp;</p> 

 
 <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
<strong>Learning Points</strong> </p> 
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">&nbsp;</p>
 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Reels:</strong> As mentioned in Week 2, we decided to try out the reels feature because reels are prominently displayed on Instagram's Reels tab, making them more discoverable to people who may not be following the brand, and they have grown in popularity, with many users actively searching out and engaging with Reels material. However, we noticed that our reels were not performing better compared to our regular posts.&nbsp;</p>  

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The Monday reel was an animated post with no sound, whereas the Wednesday reel was a still with suitable music for the post. The still reel with supporting audio reached more people due to the emotional involvement people acquire; they interact more with reels featuring audio. Nonetheless, the reel we posted in Week 3 outperformed the other two because it was trendy and resonated with the audience better.&nbsp;</p>

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Facebook Has a Different Algorithm:</strong> Although we would publish identical posts simultaneously on Instagram and Facebook with the same caption and hashtags, the posts on Instagram would perform significantly better than those on Facebook. We observed that videos performed better on Facebook, primarily if they are supported by audio. For example, through our last reel, we reached 334 people and achieved an engagement of 237, far more than we expected. Additionally, keeping our brand visible on Facebook would also require funding the posts.&nbsp;</p> 

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Carousel Posts:</strong> After Week 1, we concluded that carousel posts also drive more traffic because both carousel posts were informative and supported by illustrations or pictures. However, the carousel post with pictures outperformed the one with graphics. Carousel posts offer more creativity and flexibility regarding the content that can be shared and have higher engagement rates than single-image or video posts since viewers are more likely to spend more time interacting with the post by swiping through the carousel.&nbsp;</p> 

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Posting Days:</strong> We have created designated posting days, and each has its specific theme - Speak and Spit Mondays, Culture Clash Wednesday, Fun on Fridays, and Safe Sex Saturdays. Our set posting time was Monday - noon, Wednesday - either 1:00 PM or 7:00 PM, Friday - 10:00 AM, and Saturday - either 11:00 AM or 1:00 PM. Although we were not always available to post at the selected time, we did it close to what we had assigned.&nbsp;</p>  

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Furthermore, we have observed that Instagram posts that would frequently reach more people were published on Mondays and Fridays. Most of our audience takes a lunch break between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM. While socializing with their coworkers, they are more likely to scroll through their social media feeds. Because of the limited time frame, sharing something with which people can easily connect would be acceptable. Hence, posts on Mondays were short text over colorful backgrounds, and those on Fridays were more picture-centered.&nbsp;</p> 

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Picture-centered posts:</strong> As previously mentioned in the reflection, mainly picture-centered posts with little to no text have more engagement and drive more traffic to our Instagram page, compared to posts predominantly with text and illustrations. Our target group is young expats between 25 - 35. Therefore, posts with more text or graphics would not be as entertaining as posts with less text and more pictures. Instagram's algorithm prioritizes aesthetically appealing content and promotes posts that are more likely to be interacted with. Hence, images in postings are more likely to be seen by a larger audience, resulting in increased engagement rates.&nbsp;</p> 

 
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Future Planning</strong> 
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
<strong>Captivating Proposition</strong> </p> 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">In the span of these three weeks, Sexpats offered only suggestions and ideas for expats on how to adapt to new cultures and lead a healthy and prosperous sex life. We used this time to introduce our brand to the audience. If the project is to be continued, our brand will create its first solid offer to attract customers. An effective marketing strategy must have a concrete proposal that gives customers a reason to choose our brand. It may include a compelling cause for customers to act immediately, such as a limited-time sale. Customers will be more likely to take advantage of the deal if they are excited about it.&nbsp;</p> 

 
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
<strong>Slogan</strong> </p> 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Furthermore, to make our brand more memorable, we will create a hook that will distinguish Sexpats from other brands that offer similar products or services. For example, a slogan can go alongside our unique value proposition, making the brand stand out and positioning us as the best option on the market. Ultimately, a slogan would be a significant additional component of our marketing and communication strategy since it helps establish a lasting and distinguishable impression of our brand and the products and services it offers, promotes our branding, and develops an emotional connection with our target audience.&nbsp;</p> 

 
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
<strong>Brand Ambassadors</strong> </p> 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Word-of-mouth has been proven to be one of the most successful advertising techniques. To facilitate "spreading the word" about our brand, we can start by promoting it on our personal social media accounts. As brand ambassadors, we will advocate for our products and services. This way, we will recruit new customers who will have the potential to become brand ambassadors in the future. Hence, we will identify an emotional connection with our audience through our brand ambassadors and link their personal stories to our core values.&nbsp;</p> 

 
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
<strong>Focusing on TikTok</strong> </p> 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">TikTok has a strong user engagement rate, with users spending an average of 52 minutes daily on the platform. Therefore, we have a significant opportunity to reach and engage with our target audience. Due to the design of TikTok's algorithm, promoting relevant and engaging content for users is easily attainable. Hence, entertaining videos go viral quickly. Nonetheless, it is of great importance that our content aligns with the platform's values and tone and is tailored to our target audience.&nbsp;</p> 

 
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong> 
Creating More Picture-centered Content for Instagram</strong> </p>  

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Due to Instagram's visual nature, sharing pictures is the primary mode of communication. Thus, as we have already established, picture-centered content fits the platform's essence and resonates well with its audience.&nbsp;</p> 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Moreover, images can elicit emotions and establish relationships with the viewer. They can also successfully convey stories, and Instagram's grid format helps to promote our products and services visually. By providing more enticing and memorable content, brands can connect with their audience, build brand loyalty, and enhance engagement.&nbsp;</p> 

 
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong> 
Change The Approach on Facebook</strong> </p> 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">So far, we should have focused more on Facebook, and we also should have taken the right approach with our target audience there. As we have already established in our reflection, videos drive the most traffic to our page because they are one of the most engaging contents on the social media platform. Videos showcase our products or services, tell stories, and provide valuable information to our audience.&nbsp;</p> 

 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Another effective tool we plan on using is contests and giveaways since they will drive traffic to our page and increase our brand's exposure on Facebook. Everybody likes winning prizes; thus, offering incentives to our customers can encourage them to engage with our content and share it with friends.&nbsp;</p> 

 
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>
Invest Money in Boosting Our Posts</strong> </p>

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Last but not least, by boosting our posts, we have a higher chance of reaching more people. Hence, driving traffic to our page. However, this is only attainable if we invest money in boosting our posts on Facebook and Instagram.  </p>

									<img src="assets/images/Images coporate/Management/leancanvas1-3.jpeg" alt="visual">
									<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Problem:</strong> During the interviews conducted, it became very apparent that expats often find it difficult to make connections (friends, romantic and / or sexual). This especially applies to expats who are not attending university or are not employed at the moment and are therefore missing out on an essential point of meeting other people.</p> 
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Furthermore, some interviewees stated that they experienced fundamental differences when it comes to the local dating culture versus the dating culture of the country they lived in before. 
Lastly, interviewees also mentioned that they are fairly clueless regarding ways to improve their mental, emotional and physical (sexual) well-being. It was mentioned that some do watch self-help content on YouTube or read posts on Instagram, but most of the time they did not really know how to approach this aspect of their lives. Majority of interviewees stated that they do not actively seek support to improve their well-being on the previously mentioned levels.</p>  
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Solution</strong>: We concluded from our interviews that a platform to promote casual, open and consensual connections combined with different tools of learning would be extremely beneficial for our target group. We provide our customers with the familiar environment of a dating platform, but add certain features like in-app-translator and ice-breaker-questionnaire, self-help modules, appointments with one of our coaches, and so on. We want to encourage expats to acclimate to their local dating culture by offering them a perfectly safe and secure space where they can either meet locals or other internationals. We openly promote casual sex, but with a different and more progressive approach. We want to encourage our users to learn and reflect more about their own dating habits, issues and overall knowledge when it comes to sexual health. As a result, we do hope that there will be casual sex, but in a more responsible and sustainable way, where every party involved communicates openly and honestly. The goal in the long run is to help our users grow individually, while meeting lovely people from around the globe.</p> 
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Customer segment:</strong>.Our customer segment consists of expats aged 25 - 35 who moved to the Netherlands. The Netherlands was repeatedly chosen as a country due to its many career possibilities and perceived high quality of living, due to the infrastructure and financial aid provided. 
We ended up focusing on a slightly older target group, because we found out during the interviews that those people in particular tend to feel isolated and clueless as soon as they are not in a convenient university or work environment anymore.</p> 
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Early adapters:</strong> Our early adaptors are in the commonly occurring situation of not being enrolled in a study / employed anymore. Therefore, they feel hesitant and insecure about meeting new people. Nonetheless, they are curious and open towards making new connections and oftentimes feel like their sex life is falling behind. They are exhausted or do not feel confident to use popular dating apps like Tinder or Bumble, but also feel too young to sign up on dating websites like parship.com. As a result, they welcome our well-rounded concept of Sexpats and are happily making use of not only the meeting people feature, but also the various other tools we provide them: learning, consultation, exclusive events or workshops revolving around sex, health, self-development, etc.</p> 
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Unique value proposition:</strong> The concept of Sexpats exceeds the functions and features of any existing dating platform. We do indeed have a part of our product dedicated to help people meet each other, but more importantly, we hope to promote individual growth and increased awareness and knowledge when it comes to important fields like (sexual) health and patterns of (toxic) behavior. We consciously avoid adding another “zombie-like swiping” dating app to the market, but rather hope to add deeper value through actual learning moments to the broad dating and connecting landscape. Our goal is to reduce the stigma of casual sex and dating by providing education and support. The long-term result we are hoping for is to not only make expats less lonely, but also more aware of themselves, their partners and consequently, their new culture. This is why we chose the X-Y-analogy of “Sexpats is similar to a combination of facebook and LinkedInLearning”. We equally promote connecting people and education.</p> 
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Unfair Advantage:</strong> Our team consists of expats who have been settled in the Netherlands for a longer period of time and have successfully managed to build connections within Dutch and non-Dutch communities. More importantly. Our team has knowledge about current digital dating trends and are open to further development, changes, and improvements in this fast-changing world.</p>
<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Cost of Services:</strong>The Cost of Services can be variable and fixed. Organizing and running events and workshops include expenses like materials, supplies, and labor costs. Planning and executing an event for single expats, entering the dating world in a different country, or workshops with professional advice incur variable costs, such as renting supplies and equipment, hiring additional staff to manage the event, and marketing and advertising. On the other hand, expenses like rent for space, where the events or workshops will take place, insurance, or administrative staff salaries are fixed because they are independent of the number of events or seminars organized.</p>

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Customer Acquisition Cost:</strong>The Customer Acquisition Cost estimates the amount of money our brand spends on attracting new customers. It is a crucial business metric because it represents the overall cost of sales, marketing efforts, and property or equipment required to persuade clients to subscribe to our newsletters. The costs for paid advertising are variable because they depend on the number of ads our brand wants to place, the channels we use to communicate to our target audience, and the bidding process of the advertisement's placement. However, when Sexpats employs marketing automation to leverage our clients' data to create relevant experiences at scale, the platform's cost remains fixed regardless of how many leads are generated.</p>

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The annual salary of a marketing and sale specialist in the Netherlands for 2023 is between € 29.000 - € 51.000 gross (Marketing Specialist Salary in the Netherlands | PayScale, n.d.). Since our brand is new to the market, we have hired a marketing and sale specialist whose monthly salary will be the lowest possible due to our meager budget. Therefore, the person will earn € 2.500 monthly.</p>

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Website Maintenance:</strong> For website maintenance, we have hired a third-party provider to whom we pay a fixed monthly fee to update content, troubleshoot technical issues, or add new features. Moreover, ongoing expenses such as website hosting fees or licensing costs for software used to manage the website are also included in the services of the third-party provider. Because they remain the same over time, regardless of the level of maintenance work being performed, our costs for website maintenance are fixed. Monthly website maintenance costs € 80 (WordPress Maintenance and Support in Netherlands, n.d.).</p>

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Language Teachers:</strong> Every Monday, Sexpats has courses teaching foreign languages, and our brand provides teachers for five languages. The average hourly rate for a language teacher is € 23.68 (ERI Economic Research Institute, n.d.), and every class will take up to 2 hours. Assuming a month has four Mondays, their monthly wage will be € 947.20. It is a fixed cost, independent of how many people sign up or attend the courses.</p> 

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Dating Coach:</strong> Since our brand stands for creating a safe environment for single expats to meet new people and engage in casual and consensual partnerships, we have hired a dating coach to help our clients navigate their dating/sex life in a new country with ease. These workshops take place every Friday evening. Therefore, the salary of the dating coach depends on the number of days they have worked per month. Dating coaches are paid € 269.30 daily (Salaris Van Een Dating Coach in Noord-Holland - Bekijk Het Gemiddelde Salaris Van Een Dating Coach Op Jooble, n.d.). Assuming a month has four Fridays, their monthly wage will be € 1 077.20. It is a fixed cost, independent of how many people sign up or attend the workshops.</p>

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Office Space:</strong> Sexpats stands for building connections, and what better place to do so than meet in person. Our clients will have higher chances of meeting potential partners when they meet them in person. Thus, our courses, workshops, and events will occur in person in our offices. The site will be rented monthly, so the price will not vary and will cost us € 1 950.</p>

<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Cost per unit:</strong> Assuming that we get around five new clients daily, in a 30-day month, we will have 150 customers.
Cost per unit = Fixed costs/customers = (Office Space + Dating Coach + Language Teachers + Website Maintenance + Marketing Specialist) / customers = € 6 554.40 / 150 = € 43.70</p>


<p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Key Metrics:</strong> We are measuring the activities through monitoring many people who visited our website and how many of those actually signed up for our workshops and events. Since we are also present on social media it is important to us to know how many people joined our Facebook group and how many people have followed our Instagram as well as how many liked and shared one or more of our Instagram posts.
Channels: In order to reach and connect with our customers, we are present and active on Facebook and Instagram. We chose those channels, because they were mentioned as the most popular channels of use by our target group and also provide the best opportunities for our brand to communicate and visualize our value to our customers. We achieve this through visually engaging posts and easily digestible information, that naturally ties in the feed of our customers. 
We decided to not use Twitter, although it was also frequently mentioned by our interviewees, because we found the functionality of the platform not suitable and unnecessary for our brand.</p>
